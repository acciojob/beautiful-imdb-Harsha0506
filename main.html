	<p class="movieDetail">Sonny Hayes was once known as F1’s rising star—until a devastating crash derailed both his career and his spirit. Thirty years later, he's a drifting, gambling cab driver in New York, until his old teammate Ruben Cervantes, now the owner of a failing F1 team, APXGP, begs him for a comeback. Back in the seat and mentoring rookie Joshua Pearce, Sonny must tame his past demons while racing against the world’s best—during real Grand Prix events. From Silverstone to Abu Dhabi, Sonny races not just for redemption, but to reclaim his purpose. Featuring real drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, this high-octane drama blends adrenaline, team loyalty, and bittersweet second chances.</p>
